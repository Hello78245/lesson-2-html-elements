       <p><b>The school I go to is called "Bowditch middle school"</b><br>
        <i>The thing I like so much about it is meeting my friends<br>
        <em>But I still hate school even though I can meet my friends</em><br>
        <small>the subject I hate the most is language arts</small><br>
        <del>And the subject I like the most is Science</del><br>
        <mark>But school is like a hellscape no matter what</mark><br>
        <strong>Nobody likes it, they just pretend to like it</strong><br>
        a<sup>The teachers can be boring most of the time</sup><br>
        co<sub>The hot lunch obviously stinks and I feel bad for anyone that actually eats it</sub><br></p>
